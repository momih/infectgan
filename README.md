# InfectGAN

I created a new architecture for a GAN that I needed to use for my project. Still performing experiments, will publish later. [Initial report submitted for class](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1u8-3Nv62lichqqIdiRczyOMRPe_wABm6) (tbh I feel my methodology needs to be refined greatly)

Some code is flawed as I had to hastily adapt it for training on Google Cloud. The model architecture is as below:
